To tear two packs requires considerable strength of grip or very large hands, but to tear a single pack is extremely easy when the mode of procedure is known. The general impression of those who see the thing done is that the pack is bevelled so that the tear starts on the edge of a single card, but it is quite impossible to tear a pack in that way. The pack should be squared up and held in an upright position in the left hand. Grasp the top firmly with the right hand, with all the fingers close together on the front and the heel of the hand on the back. Then seize the bottom with the left hand, using the same grip, but with the fingers on the back and the heel on the front, and bend the pack toward the right. Twist the hands in opposite directions, turning the right away from the body, and you will be surprised to discover how easily the tear is made. Slip a rubber band around one of the halves, toss it to your audience and tear the other half again in the same manner, putting a band on the quarters and offering them also for inspection. The bend is very important, as this furnishes the fulcrum which replaces the main strength that would otherwise be necessary. If a piece of tinplate the size of the cards and of the thickness formerly used for making the boxes for Nabisco biscuits, is placed in the middle of the pack, it can be torn with the cards with practically no more exertion. To an audience this has the appearance of a veritable feat of strength. A telephone book of five hundred pages can be torn in two by a person of ordinary strength if one takes advantage of the bend."/></a>
