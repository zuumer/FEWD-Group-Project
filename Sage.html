                <h2>Starting an Outline</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first step to this method is to sketch out all the shapes of varying shadows in the original photo.
                    </li>
                    <li>I find it easiest to make sure you're reference photo is black and white when you begin. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I find it easiest to make sure you're reference photo is black and white when you begin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use this process for any photo, but the higher constract in the lighting is the simpliest. The less contrast- the more difficult to identify these shapes. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> When I am working on my initial outline I use a standard graphite pencil, making sure to use minimal presssure. Any hard pressed lines that you will erase later will indent the paper and distort your image when you begin shading.</p>

    <h2>Filling darkest areas and color</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once the main shapes of the outline are on paper, you can move on to filling in the darkest areas and line details.
        I prefer to use a fine point marker for lines that I'm positive will be black. This includes area highly shadowed, pupils nostrils etc.</li>
        <li>This is also when I start to color areas that I do not want graphite. </li>
        <li>For colored areas I use a mix of colored pencil and marker. 
            Starting with a base color and using the lightest shades with a marker under the colored pencil, gives a more vibrant color and ensures that there will be no white showing through.  
        </li>
        <li>Two more tips I've found to work well are using white colored pencil on top of darker shades of marker can gice dimension and look like reflection. As well as using a wax blending pencil to get a glossy smooth finish when blending multiple colors. </li>
    </ul>
