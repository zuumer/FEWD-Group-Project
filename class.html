    <h1>How to Build Muscle (Fast)</h1>

    <h2>Increase Your Training Volume</h2>

    <p>
      Training volume — your number of reps multiplied by your number of sets —
      is a primary determiner of hypertrophy (muscle volume growth). And to
      increase volume, you may actually need to go lower in weight than you
      might guess
    </p>

    <h2>Focus on the Eccentric Phase</h2>

    <p>
      To increase the amount of eccentric effort in your workout, you can do two
      things: either slow down the eccentric phase of each exercise you perform
      or integrate eccentric-only variations into your routine
    </p>

    <h2>To Grow Muscle, Eat More Protein</h2>

    <p>
      Strength training breaks down your muscles, and protein builds them back
      up. The more difficult your lifting workouts are, the more important
      muscle-building foods become when weighing protein intake to solidify
      recovery, Fitzgerald explains
    </p>

    <h2>Get More Sleep</h2>

    <p>
      Muscle recovery requires more than the right nutrition. It takes time —
      roughly eight hours per night — dedicated to recovery. After all, when you
      sleep, your body releases human growth hormone, which helps grow muscle
      and keeps levels of the stress hormone cortisol in check.
